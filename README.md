# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to solve the TSP using three different methods:
- Brute Force -Exact Algo
- Branch and Bound-Exact Algo
- Ant Colony Optimization--Heuristic Algo(still work in progress)

  also note to mention other methods, e.g
Dynamic Programming
Nearest Neighbour
Genetic Algorithm

Each method is implemented in its own folder under `methods/`.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Pull the latest changes from the main branch.
2. Create a new branch for your task:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Work on your assigned method/module.
4. Commit your changes with descriptive messages.
5. Push your branch to GitHub.
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into main.
7. Request reviews from your team members.
8. After approvals, merge your PR.

## Team Task Division
Member 1- Intoduce TSP, why it matters e.t.c
- Member 2-3: Implement and optimize Brute Force method (`methods/brute_force/`)
- Member 3-4: Implement and optimize Branch and Bound method (`methods/branch_and_bound/`)
- Member 4: Finalize with Implementing and optimize Ant Colony Optimization method (`methods/ant_colony_optimization/`)
- Member 5-6: Visualization of the routes and Optimization
- Member 7:
- Member 8-9: Slides compilation and Presentation Support
- Member 10: Project integration, testing, and documentation

## How to Run
Instructions to be added once implementations are complete.
