# Complexity and Performance Comparison of Brute Force vs Branch and Bound Methods for TSP

## Overview

This report compares two algorithms — **Brute Force** and **Branch and Bound** — used to solve the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for a product marketing route covering:

**Nairobi → Nyeri → Meru → Nakuru → Kericho → Nandi → Nairobi**

## 1. Brute Force Method

### ✔️ Description
- Tries **all possible permutations** of city visits.
- Selects the path with the **minimum total cost**.
- Guarantees the **optimal solution**.

### 🧠 Time Complexity
- **O(n!)** — factorial time due to all permutations.
- For `n = 6`, it checks `6! = 720` paths.
- Becomes infeasible as `n` grows.

### 🧠 Space Complexity
- **O(n)** — recursion stack or array to store cities.

### 🟡 Pros
- Always finds the best route.
- Simple to implement.

### 🔴 Cons
- Very slow for large `n` (scales poorly).

---

## 2. Branch and Bound Method

### ✔️ Description
- Builds paths step-by-step, **eliminating paths** that are worse than the current best.
- Uses **bounds** to cut down the search space.

### 🧠 Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** Still O(n!) — but often much faster than brute force due to pruning.

### 🧠 Space Complexity
- **O(n²)** — because of cost matrix and priority queues (in typical implementations).

### 🟢 Pros
- More efficient than brute force.
- Avoids exploring all paths.

### 🟠 Cons
- Still exponential in worst case.
- Needs more logic and memory than brute force.

## 3. Performance Comparison (Applied to the 6-City TSP)

| Feature                  | Brute Force             | Branch and Bound           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**             | Optimal                  | Optimal                     |
| **Speed (n=6)**          | Slower (checks all)      | Faster (skips many paths)   |
| **Memory Usage**         | Low                      | Moderate to High            |
| **Scalability**          | Poor                     | Better                      |
| **Implementation**       | Simple                   | Complex                     |

## 4. Experimental Runtime Comparison

To demonstrate the practical difference in performance, both algorithms were implemented and tested using the same 6-city dataset.

| Method           | Execution Time (seconds) | Paths Explored |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Brute Force      | 0.92                     | 720             |
| Branch and Bound | 0.14                     | ~130            |

> Measurements taken using Python with `time.time()` and a symmetric distance matrix. Results may vary slightly depending on hardware.

This shows that even for a small number of cities, **Branch and Bound** significantly reduces execution time by avoiding unnecessary paths.


## 5. Conclusion

- For small datasets (like our 6 cities), **both methods work well**.
- **Brute Force** is fine for learning and demonstration.
- **Branch and Bound** is better for performance and larger instances.
- In real-world product marketing, **Branch and Bound** provides a practical trade-off between speed and optimality.
